Development of Code for the DNS of cloud flows

This repository is developed by Manmeet Singh working under Dr Shivsai Dixit at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology on the development of codes for numerical simulation of cloud flows.

The project at present is uderway and the jet flow with slip boundary conditions in a box have been developed in matlab which is being tried to simulate in fortran with traction free boundary conditions. 

The attached files include the research papers and reports that have helped ud in developing the code so far.
